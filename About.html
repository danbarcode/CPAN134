                <h2>League Of Legends</h2><br>
                Over here I will explain to you what League Of Legends is all about. League Of Legends, or LoL, is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)<br>
                made by Riot Games. The initial release date for League was October 27, 2009, so it is a very old game but still one worth playing.<br>
                LoL is a 5v5 team based game where you fight to defeat the enemies nexus.
